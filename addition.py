description: Python program that demonstrates the usage of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. Perform a few operations and print the results.
Instructions:

    Perform addition and division using two integers (a = 10, b = 5).
    Compare the two integers using the greater-than (>) and equality (==) operators.
    Use logical operators (and, or) to check conditions.
    Display the results of all the operations.

Expected Output:

Sum: 15, Division: 2.0

Is a greater than b?: True

Are a and b equal?: False

Logical AND: True

Logical OR: True
